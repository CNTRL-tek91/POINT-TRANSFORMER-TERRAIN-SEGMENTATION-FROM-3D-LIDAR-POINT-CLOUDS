## Environment + Simulation tools
Below is the required environment setup for the project due to compatibility issues regarding the AgileX Scout Mini simulation model.

  * OS: Ubuntu 20.04
      * Installation: [https://releases.ubuntu.com/focal/](https://releases.ubuntu.com/focal/)
  * ROS version: ROS 1 Noetic
      * Installation: [https://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu](https://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu)
  * Simulaton Environment: Gazebo Classic
      * Installation: [https://classic.gazebosim.org/](https://classic.gazebosim.org/)
  * Data Recording: Rviz
      * Included with the installation of ROS 1 Noetic

## Key Features/Steps
Below is a list of features involved in the creation of this project

1. Custom, procedurally generated 3D terrains that maintain an even distribution of smooth, drivable areas and steep, rugged terrain.
   
    * 3D terrains were built with Blender using a Geometry Node system. The following link was used as a guide to create the Geometry Node system: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VIK1Ct6jLM&t=120s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VIK1Ct6jLM&t=120s)
   
    * 28 total terrains created, each exported as Collada(DAE) files for simulation compatibility.
